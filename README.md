## ✨ Motivation 

This project is a put-together exercise for &lt;form&gt;, &lt;input&gt;, &lt;label&gt;, &lt;button&gt;, &lt;select&gt; and &lt;option&gt; elements as well as the form validations in HTML. I also experimented with CSS and Flexbox for styling to spice it up! Below is the original version from the tutorial:
